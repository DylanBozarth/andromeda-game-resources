            <li class="bullet-point">What's the game about? </li>
            <p class="answer">Andromeda will be a 4x strategy game set in space. The main objective will be managing
                your
                empire, trading and fighting with other players.
                The story is: Humans are colonizing a new galaxy. <br /> The story is purposely very open ended so that
                players can
                create their own stories in game. </p>
            <li class="bullet-point">What will be the main purpose of the game?</li>
            <p class="answer">Your main goal will be to survive. <br />The galaxy is full of hostile and malevolent
                powers,
                while
                also being full of curiosities that you will want to explore.
                <br /> Survive, thrive, cooperate, and conquer.
            </p>
            <li class="bullet-point">What kind of rules will apply to players?</li>
            <p class="answer">We have one basic rule: no hacking the game or into other player's accounts. <br />Do you
                want
                to backstab, lie, steal, raid, create monopolies, or create a galatic empire with your friends? Go for
                it!
            </p>
            <li class="bullet-point">What is a 4x game? </li>
            <p class="answer">4X games usually feature complex simulations of scientific research, economics, diplomacy,
                and
                social dynamics. Instead of controlling a single person or ship in space, you will be deciding the fate
                of
                an entire civlization</p>
            <li class="bullet-point">What platform will this be on?</li>
            <p class="answer">This game will be browser based, so it will work on anything with an internet connection.
                <br /> <i>We do not recomend playing on your smart fridge</i>

        As of now we are working on creating a minimum viable product. We are working towards a playable but scaled down
