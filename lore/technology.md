Space is very big, faster than light travel does not exist. 
There is very fast (relatively) interstellar travel but there are limitations
1. It is a one shot trip. There is no stopping unless you apply an equal force to the other direction. You can't just turn the engines off and visit a nearby planet, an emergency stop would leave you stranded as you cannot carry that much fuel.
2. Because of the long travel times between stars, isolated planets and stars are very rarely governed by offworld governments. Similar to colonies in Earth's history. Things would simply take too long to govern.
3. Hypersleep is used to travel between stars, and general relativity means that the time spent on board is not the same as the travel time. (this wont affect the game it will only affect lore)
4. Large parts of the galaxy remain unexplored because of the speed limitation.
