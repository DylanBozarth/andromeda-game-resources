General Story: 
Humanity is at a stage where they can travel between the stars not faster than light but pretty fast. There's been a wormhole discovered to a galaxy where the stars are much closer together and nobody has a claim. Everyone goes to seek their fortune.  There are as many different factions and interests as on earth today.

Human factions: (Will help or hurt you based of reputation)
The templars:
Banking cartel that has come to Andromeda from the wormhole. They want to make money and that's all they care about.
