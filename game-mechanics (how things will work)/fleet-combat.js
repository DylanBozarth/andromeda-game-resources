/* 
Fleets will be how ships are able to move from system to system. The player will have to make a fleet (even if it's just one ship) to move ships. 
Fleets will attack each other if they're in the same area of space and at war, no order needs to be given.
Mechanics: 
Once the fleets meet each other there will be an exchange where both sides fire their ammo at each other. 
The damage of one fleet will be subtracted from the health of the other fleet (killing small or big ships in the process, they do not share a health pool)
Every 30 minutes there will be another exchange with the remaining ships, with the intervals reducing every 5 minutes as the fleets get closer to each other. 
There will be exchanges until one side does not have any ships.
