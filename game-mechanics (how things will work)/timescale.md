Things in this game will not be played at a break-neck pace. This will be more like a mobile game where buildings take hours or days to build
And fleets will take very long to reach other star systems (depending on distance)
This mechanic is mainly to limit players from being conquered while they are asleep or at work, wars will take weeks/months not hours 
The game is also not turned based, but online and real-time, the time delay mostly exists to allow for an always online strategy game.
