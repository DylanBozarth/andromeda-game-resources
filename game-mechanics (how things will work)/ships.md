Ships will have the following attributes
Armor,
Hull-integrity,
Manpower, (On non drone ships)
fuel,
munitions

Armor will protect the ship obviously. No penalty when it reaches 0. Most weapons can damage the ammor AND hull. It does not work like a shield, some damage will get through
Hull integrity will basically be the HP of the ship. If it's 0 it dies
Manpower and fuel will work the same, if one reaches 0 the ship will be disabled. We can add scavenging mechanics later, for now it will just be destroyed.
Manpower and fuel will have to be refilled in a system
Munitions will work like a "mana" system, the ship will use munitions will fighting, and need to be resupplied either at a system or by not fighting for a while (supply lines will just be automatic)
