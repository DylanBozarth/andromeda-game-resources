Buildings will have a cost to build. This is the resources needed all at once to build.
Buildings will also have an upkeep cost, this will be taken from the player's bank every day. 
With the exception of manpower, manpower is a one time cost for upkeep, and is refunded if the building is destroyed. (we can program this later) 



How building will work:
The future doesn't have construction workers, the building is done by construction drones. These drones cost materials to build and power to function, the more drones the faster things get built. (Ships/buildings). 
Construction drones will cost a lot of power to keep running, so the player will need to choose between heavy industrialisation and other paths that require lots of power.
Construction drones can be assigned to a single project at a time, multiple things can be built with different drones. 
Example: 6 drones can build 6 buildings at the same time, just very slowly. 
OR they can build 1 building 6 times faster.
