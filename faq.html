    <ul class="faq-list" id="faq">
        <li class="bullet-point">What's the game about? </li>
        <p class="answer">Andromeda will be a 4x strategy game set in space. The main objective will be managing your
            empire, trading and fighting with other players.
            The story is: Humans are colonizing a new galaxy. <br /> The story is purposely very open ended so that
            players can
            create their own stories in game. </p>
        <li class="bullet-point">What will be the main purpose of the game?</li>
        <p class="answer">Your main goal will be to survive. <br />The galaxy is full of hostile and malevolent powers,
            while
            also being full of curiosities that you will want to explore.
            <br /> Survive, thrive, cooperate, and conquer.
        </p>
        <li class="bullet-point">What kind of rules will apply to players?</li>
        <p class="answer">We have one basic rule: no hacking the game or into other player's accounts. <br />Do you want
            to backstab, lie, steal, raid, create monopolies, or create a galatic empire with your friends? Go for it!
        </p>
        <li class="bullet-point">What is a 4x game? </li>
        <p class="answer">4X games usually feature complex simulations of scientific research, economics, diplomacy, and
            social dynamics. Instead of controlling a single person or ship in space, you will be deciding the fate of
            an entire civlization</p>
        <li class="bullet-point">What platform will this be on?</li>
        <p class="answer">This game will be browser based, so it will work on anything with an internet connection.
            <br /> We do not recomend playing on your smart fridge however</p>

        As of now we are working on creating a minimum viable product. We are working towards a playable but scaled down version of our game. <br />You can check on our progress
